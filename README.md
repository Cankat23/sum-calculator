# Sum Calculator (C++)

A simple C++ program that calculates the sum of integers from 1 to a given number N.

## How it works
* The user is prompted to enter an integer number.
* The program calculates the sum instantly using the mathematical formula: `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
* Finally, it prints the total sum to the screen.

## Concepts used
* for loop
* `cin` / `cout` (Input & Output)
* Variables (`long long` to avoid overflow)
* Arithmetic operators
* Mathematical Algorithm (Gauss Formula)
