# Sum Calculator (C++)

A simple C++ program that calculates the sum of integers from 1 to a given number N.

## How it works
**Input:** The user is prompted to enter an integer number.
**Validation:** The program checks if the number is greater than `999,999,999`.
* If the number is too big, it warns the user and requests a smaller number to prevent integer overflow.
**Calculation:** The program calculates the sum instantly using the mathematical formula: `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
**Output:** Finally, it prints the total sum to the screen.

## Concepts used
* Mathematical Algorithm (Gauss Formula)
* `cin` / `cout` (Input & Output)
* Variables `long long`
* `while` loop (Input Validation)
* Arithmetic operators
* Overflow Protection
